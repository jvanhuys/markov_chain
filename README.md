The idea

Markov Summary:
1. Predict future process based on current (provided) process
2. Current process should be match above criteria, based on known previous history.

Two types of Markov: *discreet vs continuous (discreet is based on natural numbers 0-10etc continuous is the stuff in between
1. Discrete state space: all possible configurations of a system, like a ’shortest path problem’ or ‘queueing theory’ (e.g. Supermart: choose bulk items queue with few people or the express queue with many people)
2. Discrete index set: a set is items of clothing {hat, pants, shirt} or a hand {middle, index, pinky}. An Index (or dictionary) set, is an index within an index, more specifically, an index whos members index members of another set. Also called an (indexed) family. Below: Index members of Y can contain one or more member(s) from X.
